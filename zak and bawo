When developing a strategic plan, four ethical considerations include: 

Transparency: Ensuring openness and honesty in decision-making processes. 

Fairness: Equitable treatment of all stakeholders involved. 

Accountability: Taking responsibility for actions and their consequences. 

Sustainability: Considering long-term impacts on society and the environment.
