Task 1  

Newcastle College uses a variety of different policies to ensure that positive behaviours are prioritised and that negative behaviours are quickly met with interventions and changes to the environment to support growth. As the most obvious example of this, would be the NCG Student Behaviour Policy, which details what behavioural goals students should be pushed towards and what negative influences they should be removed from. 

This Student Code of Conduct is designed to be followed by all students, with them all signing this document at the beginning of the course to ensure that they comply.

Ethical considerations to developing a strategic plan could be employee working hours, health & safety considerations, vacation and leave then finally diversity and inclusion.  

 

A whistleblower may highlight worker exploitation, health & safety failures, mismanagement or fraud within the organisation. 

 

A strong, positive culture may mean that workers are more likely to work more efficiently and have a less stressful time while doing so. 

 

Employers can create positivity by raising wages, increasing vacations or listening to the complaints of their employees and resolving them.
